To get code from remote repository to local directory

git pull and press enter

Code Conflict/ Conflict

Consider, Deepak and Srinu

If srinu pull the code from the git first and working on it 
while srinu working it is the version v1
Now deepak pull the same v1 and doing changes in the file

So now deepak pushed the code after changes so that it became v2

And now srinu pushing his updated v1 code , it displays an error which is called conflict,

so, srinu should pull the code again it will automatically merge into your existing code and so srinu should work on it according to the changes and need to push again.



TO revert the changes from local to staging area:

git restore --staged filename(ex: teja.txt)

The file teja.txt will go back to the local directory


To go bact from commit changes

git --reset hard commit-id

The commit id should be the one where you want to go back. If u r having 5 commit changes so now you want to go back to 2nd commit change then enter the 2nd commit id in command.



Delete file from GitHub:

Git rm file name

If you directly use rm command it will delete only in local directory, so use git rm command to delete on remote repository, 
After deleting the files, again add,commit,push to git then it will update changes.
